# ML_Model_Assessment

## Self-Assessment

Over the course of the machine learning project, I took on roles of and contributed to data cleaning, data analysis, database storage, training and testing the machine learning model, the Google Slides presentation, and organizing the GitHub repository. Doing the project individually definitely posed challenged in terms of time management and meeting individual deliverable deadlines on-time. Looking back, choosing a partner for the work would have helped meeting deliverables on-time. 


## Team-Assessment

Since I did the project individually, there was no team involved.

## Summary

Conducted a project using a machine learning model to classify a superhero as a hero or a villain by analyzing comic book datasets. Random forests classifier yielded the strongest score and classification report. Results showed classifying superhero models a medium-strong accuracy of 75% and evil characters are better predicted using intelligence or power.
